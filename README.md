# Jmeter plugins

This repository is used to store my Jmeter plugins. 

All plugins are distributed as single Uber-Jar file.
If you install it you'll get all plugins within one file.


## JWTEncoder

This plugin is used to create JSON web tokens and store them
as a variable in Jmeter's context.

Currently it can encode only using HS256 algorithm. More algoritms will be 
added in the future if needed.
